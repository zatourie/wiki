간단한 코드 테스트를 위해 더이상 VS를 키지 않아도 되겠네요.

ABOUT US


We are a group of .NET developers who are sick and tired of starting Visual Studio, creating a new project and running it, just to test simple code or try out samples from other developers.  And as to sharing code and samples, don't even get me started.

This tool was inspired by http://www.jsfiddle.net, which is just awesome.
