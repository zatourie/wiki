      * **Sometimes language designers make mistakes.
      *** Java applets failed.
      * **JavaScript has some extraordinarily good parts. In JavaScript, there is a beautiful, elegant, highly expressive language that is buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders.
      *** This book will not attempt to fully describe the language. Instead, it will focus on the good parts with occasional warnings to avoid the bad.
      * **The very good ideas include functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation.
      *** JavaScript's functions are first class object with (mostly) lexical scoping. JavaScript is the first lambda language to go mainstream. JavaScript has more in common with Lisp and Scheme than with Java.
      * **It is Lisp in C's clothing.
      *** Why should I use JavaScript? The first is that you don't have a choice.
      * **Unlike many other languages, blocks in JavaScript do not create a new scope, so variables should be defined at the top of the function, not in blocks.**
